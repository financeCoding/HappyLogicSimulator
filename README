This is a simple digital logic simulator written in Dart.  

You can add logic devices to the simulator and connect them to simulate various 
logic conditions. This program is intended to help the user to understand logic 
gates and flip flops through experimentation.  My goal is to make the simulation 
as easy to use as possible.  My 4 yr old son is the primary ui tester.

I started this project at the Silicon Valley 2012 Dart Hackathon

It is under development, so expect lots of changes.....
